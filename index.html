          Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced
          education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical
          experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
          Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United
          States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked
          for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before
          he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and
          market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York
          to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His
          alternating current (AC) induction motor and related

          AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a
          considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the
          polyphase system which that company would eventually market.

          Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla
          conducted a range of experiments with mechanical
          oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray
          imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first
          ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would
          demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his
          lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout
          the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide
          wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage,
          high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In
          1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless
          communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to
          practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an
          intercontinental

          and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete
          it.

          After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in
          the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most
          of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving
          behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's
          work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960,
          when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit
          of

          the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular
          interest in Tesla since the 1990s.
